## Get Involved

<!-- Right now, open communities are building amazing software together, and there are excellent "good first issue" opportunities, if you're looking to get involved.

The Coding & Robotics Club provides participating students an opportunity to learn the basics of computer programming in a team setting. The club's main focus is on creating applications, websites, games, and other projects to share with the community.

If you are interested in joining the club or just want to see what we are all about please contact club advisor, Mr. Dale. His contact information is listed below. -->
